This is a sample application based on the EnhancedViews concept.

An EnhancedView represents itself by providing the following information:

1) A title icon (optional, Component)
2) A title (nls enabled)

3) A backed object (optional, can be used to refer business data behind the view)

4) A content (Component)
5) A toolbar (optional, will be shown in the title)
6) A header (optional, will be shown as header)
7) A footer (optional, will be shown as footer)

Enhanced Views can be displayed using an EnhancedViewContainer:

A) EnhancedTabs
B) EnhancedDialog

An EnhancedTabs shows every EnhancedView as a tab, the EnhancedDialog shows one EnhancedView as a dialog.
All EnhancedViewContainers try to create their components lazy on demand. Created components will be cached so they don't loose their state.

The EnhancedTabs allow reordering and drag and drop of their tabs, on the same EnhancedTabs or to an other EnhancedTabs.
A double-click on a tab of the tabs or the title of a dialog switches the EnhancedView between a tab and a dialog.

EnhancedViews can be closeable (or not) and have the possibility to react to close, including veto or a deferred confirmation.
